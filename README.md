# PHP bindings for ElasticSearch schema

This library provides basic bindings for ElasticSearch schema - reading
and rendering schema as native PHP objects.

## Installation

This project requires PHP 7.1, ext-json and symfony/yaml (through 
`ama-team/elasticsearch-schema-definitions`) to work correctly.

```bash
composer require ama-team/elasticsearch-schema
```
